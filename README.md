# Data Aggregator
> A central location of data collected from several different systems and offered up through an API

The Data Aggregator is part of a large internal project to consolidate data across many disparate systems
at the Art Institute of Chicago into a single, unified source. This offers our products a rich set of
data that can be accessed in one way, in one location.


## Features

* All data available via a JSON-based REST API
* Large lists are paginated
* Complex data types can be "included" in requests
* Seed data provided for all resources
* Unit tests for all endpoints


## Overview

The Data Aggregator interfaces with several internal APIs to collect its data. All data is imported and served
up locally so that at runtime the API doesn't have dependencies on other systems. `artisan` commands have
been set up to import data from various sources, either en masse or incrementally. One of the greatest benefits
of an aggregator like this one is the ability to provide relationship between resources across systems. Our `/artworks`
endpoint is a great example, as you can see relationships they have to a number of different things, like mobile tours,
digital publications, and historic static sites.


## Requirements

The project has been built in Laravel, and includes the following requirements:

* Laravel 5.6
* PHP 7.1 (may work in earlier versions but hasn't been tested)
* MySQL 5.7 (may work in earlier versions but hasn't been tested)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)


## Installing

To get started with this project, use the following commands:

```shell
# Clone the repo to your computer
git clone https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/data-aggregator.git

# Enter the folder that was created by the clone
cd data-aggregator

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install
```


## Developing

First you'll need to create a `.env` file and update it to reflect your environment. We've provided an
example file to get you started:

```shell
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate a new key for your Laravel project
php artisan key:generate
```

Then, to create the database tables and seed them with fake data, run:

```shell
php artisan migrate --seed
```

This will create all the tables and relationships, and fill the tables with data from the
[Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) PHP library.


### Importing real data

We've created a series of `artisan` tasks to import data from source systems. You can see all the available
imports like so:

```shell
php artisan list import
```

To import all data from all systems, run:

```shell
php artisan import:all
```

### Adding a new data source

See [here](ADD_NEW_DATA_SOURCE.md) for details on adding new data sources to the Aggregator.
